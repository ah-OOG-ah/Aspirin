Code from Hodgepodge was used for the Mixin setup, under the LGPLv3. However, I couldn't find an actual copyright notice
in the repo, and this project is already under the LGPLv3, so this is the best I can do. The relevant files have
Copyright $YEARX various authors (from Hodgepodge)
where $YEARX is <file creation year>-<last edit year at time of use> in the copyright notice headers. Note that this is
counter to the FSF convention used in other copyright notices - this is simply due to it being impractical to
retroactively find every copyright date, as Hodgepodge also doesn't report copyright years.
