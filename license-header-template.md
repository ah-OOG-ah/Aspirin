# License template
The multiline commit below is the header used for .java files. No actual automatic variable replacement is performed,
the $NAMEs represent things you'll have to manually edit. This template follows the FSF's guidelines
[here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html)

A breakdown of the header:
- One "Copyright (C) ..." line should be added per-author.
- $YEARS should be a list of years in which the file was modified, delimited by ", ". Spans like "2020-2024" should only
  be used when the file was modified in all of those years.
- $AUTHOR0 should be the name of the author who modified the file during $YEARS0.
- The $YEARSX over several lines may be the same, but they don't have to be. The $AUTHORSX over several lines must be
  unique - only one line per author.
- If the copyright line is followed by `(from $PROJECT)`, it has been included from another project which may or may not
  follow the same conventions as this one - as such, it may not be as accurate. Check
  [3RD-PARTY-LICENSES](/3RD-PARTY-LICENSES) for details.
